# Getting setup

Forked - for the rest see [original repository](https://github.com/pentaphobe/react-playground)

## Installation

Should just be a matter of `yarn`

## Running

`yarn start`

> CAVEAT: currently there are some static es5 scripts which are processed separately to the bundle, ideally this would be an extra webpack output with different loader - but this is low priority for this POC.
> In the interim, any change to `src/static/lib` will require running `yarn run copy-static`
